# SPI Slave with Single-Port RAM
> **By:** Farah Haitham & Mohammed Yasser
This project implements an SPI Slave module interfaced with a Single-Port Synchronous RAM using Verilog.
It enables read and write operations via SPI communication, with the internal RAM serving as the storage for transferred data. The design ensures synchronous operation with the SPI clock while maintaining reliable data integrity between the communication and memory blocks.

## Features

- SPI Slave interface compliant with standard SPI modes.
- Full-duplex communication via MOSI and MISO.
- Single-Port Synchronous RAM for data storage.
- Supports both read and write operations.
- Synchronous operation with SCK from master.
- Parameterized memory depth and data width.
- Fully synthesizable Verilog code.
- Testbench for functional verification.

## Design Files

- `SPI.v`: Verilog module for SPI slave implementation.  
- `RAM.v`: Verilog module for single-port RAM.  
- `SPI_Wrapper.v`: Top-level verilog module for integrating SPI slave and RAM modules.  
- `SPI_Wrapper_tb.v`: Verilog testbench for simulation and verification of the SPI wrapper.  
- `run.do`: Script file for automating the simulation process.  

## Getting Started

To work with this project, you’ll need a **Verilog simulator**. 
**QuestaSim** is recommended.

### 1. Quick Simulation (Recommended)

A preconfigured script `run.do` is provided to automate the simulation.

Steps:
1. Ensure your simulator is installed and licensed.
2. Open a terminal or simulator console.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run:
   do run.do
5. The script will:
   - Compile all Verilog files.
   - Load the testbench.
   - Run the simulation.
   - Display the waveform.

### 2. Manual Simulation (Optional)

1. Compile source files from `src/`.
2. Compile testbench files from `tb/`.
3. Load the top-level testbench (`SPI_Wrapper_tb.v`).
4. Run the simulation and observe waveforms.

### 3. Testbench

- The provided `SPI_Wrapper_tb.v` contains example SPI slave with RAM operations.
- Extend with custom vectors for more thorough testing.
